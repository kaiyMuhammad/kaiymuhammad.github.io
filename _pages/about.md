Thank you for stopping by!

I am an undergrad CS student at RIT with the goal of entering the field of robotics research. My interest include state estimation, 3D reconstruction, multimodal fusion, image processing, semantic scene understanding, RL, and foundation models.

I am looking for a robotics PhD opening to hopfully begin in the Fall of 2025 and any opportunities to gain experience as a research assistant from January - August of 2025.

This summer, my research at MIT Lincoln Labs focuses on 1) multi-modal 3D reconstruction research with NeRFs and Gaussian Splatting, 2) semantic navigation in collaboration with [Stanford's Multi-Robot Systems Lab](https://msl.stanford.edu/)  and 3) finetuning foundational models for manipulators in collaboration with [Dorsa Sadigh also at Stanford](https://dorsa.fyi/).

After this upcoming fall semester at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/), I will complete my Bachelor's degree. For my thesis, I am working on a VIO research tool advised by [Prof. Zack Butler](https://www.rit.edu/directory/zxbvcs-zachary-butler) inspired by the state estimation work I did on co-op.

My work experience has involved AUVs, UAVS, mobile robots, legged robots, manipulators, and lunar rovers which has made me very adaptable. The common thread between these experiences is computer vision with the exeption of my time at NASA JPL.
