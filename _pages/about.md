I am a student at the Rochester Institure of Technology with an interest in robotics research. The topics that intrigue me right now include state estimation, 3D reconstruction, multimodal fusion.

I am looking for opportunities as a research assistant from January - August of 2025.

My research this summer at MIT Lincoln Labs focuses on 1) multi-modal 3D reconstruction research based on NeRFs and Gaussian Splatting, 2) semantic navigation, and 3) and foundational reinforcement learning models for manipulators.

I have one semester left of undergrad at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/)  in the Computer Science department. I am working on a VIO research tool for my Bachelors Thesis and was advised by [Prof. Zack Butler](https://www.rit.edu/directory/zxbvcs-zachary-butler).


My work experience has involved AUVs, UAVS, mobile robots, legged robots, manipulators, and lunar rovers! The common thread is that I have focused on perception and navigation with the exeption of my time as a systems engineering intern at NASA JPL.
